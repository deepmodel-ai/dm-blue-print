  "description": "A multi-agent system that extracts intent from input and schedules meetings.",
  "overview": "The 'meeting_scheduler' blueprint uses a sequence of agents to understand user input and automate the meeting scheduling process. The `intent_parser` extracts key details such as participants, time, and topic from natural language. Next, the `availability_checker` scans connected calendars to find suitable time slots. Finally, the `scheduler` books the meeting using calendar APIs. This automation simplifies coordination and eliminates the need for manual back-and-forth communication.",
